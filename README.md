git-view
========

A python-based git history to HTML converter.

How to use it:

There are two python scripts: git-view.py and git-view-2.py. Currently only git-view-2.py is supported, as git-view.py is still a work in progress.

You can just run "./git-view-2.py" to get instructions on how to run the script.
